=begin 
Write a method that takes an Array of integers as input, multiplies all the numbers together, divides the result by the number of entries in the Array, and then prints the result rounded to 3 decimal places. Assume the array is non-empty.

Input: An array of integers
Output: An integer that represents the integers from the input array multiplied together and divided by the amount of elements in the array, rounded to 3 decimal places 

Rules:
multiply the numbers in the array 
divide by the count of numbers in the array 
return the number with 3 decimal places

show_multiplicative_average([3, 5])                # => The result is 7.500
show_multiplicative_average([6])                   # => The result is 6.000
show_multiplicative_average([2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]) # => The result is 28361.667

Algorithm:
  counted variable to reference the count of the array

def show_multiplicative_average(numbers)
  product = 1.to_f
  numbers.each { |number| product *= number }
  average = product / numbers.size
  puts "The result is #{format('%.3f', average)}"
end

show_multiplicative_average([3, 5])                # => The result is 7.500
show_multiplicative_average([6])                   # => The result is 6.000
show_multiplicative_average([2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]) # => The result is 28361.667
